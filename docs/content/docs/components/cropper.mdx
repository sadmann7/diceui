## Layout

Import the parts, and compose them together.

```tsx
import {
  Cropper,
  CropperArea,
  CropperImage,
  CropperVideo,
} from "@/components/ui/cropper";

<Cropper>
  <CropperImage src="/image.jpg" alt="Image to crop" />
  <CropperArea />
</Cropper>
```

## Examples

### Controlled State

A cropper with external controls for zoom, rotation, and crop position.

<AutoTypeTable
  path="./types/docs/cropper.ts"
  name="ImageProps"
/>

### Video

The video element to be cropped.

<AutoTypeTable
  path="./types/docs/cropper.ts"

## Accessibility

### Keyboard Interactions

<KeyboardShortcutsTable
  shortcuts={[
    {
      keys: ["Tab"],
      description: "Moves focus to the cropper content.",
    },
    {
      keys: ["ArrowUp"],
      description: "Moves the crop area up by the keyboard step amount.",
    },
    {
      keys: ["ArrowDown"],
      description: "Moves the crop area down by the keyboard step amount.",
    },
    {
      keys: ["ArrowLeft"],
      description: "Moves the crop area left by the keyboard step amount.",
    },
    {
      keys: ["ArrowRight"],
      description: "Moves the crop area right by the keyboard step amount.",
    },
    {
      keys: ["Shift + Arrow Keys"],
      description: "Moves the crop area with finer precision (20% of keyboard step).",
    },
  ]}
/>

### Mouse and Touch Interactions

- **Drag**: Pan the media within the crop area
- **Scroll/Wheel**: Zoom in and out (can be disabled with `preventScrollZoom`)
- **Pinch**: Zoom and rotate on touch devices
- **Two-finger drag**: Pan while maintaining pinch zoom

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Crop Calculations

You can use the crop data from `onCropComplete` to perform server-side cropping:

```tsx
const onCropComplete = (croppedArea, croppedAreaPixels) => {
  // croppedArea contains percentages (0-100)
  // croppedAreaPixels contains actual pixel coordinates
  
  // Send to server for processing
  cropImage({
    x: croppedAreaPixels.x,
    y: croppedAreaPixels.y,
    width: croppedAreaPixels.width,
    height: croppedAreaPixels.height,
  });
};
```

### Performance Optimization

The cropper includes several performance optimizations:

- **LRU Caching**: Frequently used calculations are cached
- **RAF Throttling**: UI updates are throttled using requestAnimationFrame
- **Quantization**: Values are quantized to reduce cache misses
- **Lazy Computation**: Expensive calculations are deferred when possible

### Object Fit Modes

The cropper supports different object fit modes:

- **contain**: Media fits entirely within the container (default)
- **cover**: Media covers the entire container, may be cropped
- **horizontal-cover**: Media width matches container width
- **vertical-cover**: Media height matches container height

## Browser Support

### Core Features

All core cropping features work in modern browsers:

- **Chrome/Edge**: Full support
- **Firefox**: Full support  
- **Safari**: Full support (iOS 13+)

### Touch Gestures

Multi-touch gestures require modern touch APIs:

- **iOS Safari**: Supported from iOS 13+
- **Chrome Mobile**: Full support
- **Firefox Mobile**: Basic touch support

### Video Support

Video cropping requires modern video APIs:

- **Chrome/Edge**: Full support for all video formats
- **Firefox**: Full support with some codec limitations
- **Safari**: Full support with H.264/HEVC

## Troubleshooting

### CORS Issues

When cropping images from external domains, ensure proper CORS headers:

```tsx
<CropperImage
  src="https://example.com/image.jpg"
  crossOrigin="anonymous"
  alt="External image"
/>
```

### Performance with Large Media

For large images or videos, consider:

1. Pre-processing media to reasonable sizes
2. Using `snapPixels` for crisp rendering
3. Limiting zoom range with `minZoom` and `maxZoom`
4. Reducing `keyboardStep` for smoother interactions

### Mobile Considerations

On mobile devices:

- Use appropriate viewport meta tags
- Consider touch target sizes for controls
- Test pinch-to-zoom interactions
- Ensure adequate spacing around interactive elements
