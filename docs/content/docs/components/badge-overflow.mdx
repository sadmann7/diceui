## API Reference

### BadgeOverflow

The component that measures available space and displays badges with overflow indicators.

<AutoTypeTable
  path="./types/docs/badge-overflow.ts"
  name="BadgeOverflowProps"
/>

## Features

### Automatic Width Measurement

The component automatically measures badge widths using DOM measurement and caches results for performance. This ensures accurate overflow calculations without manual configuration.

### Multi-line Support

Control how many lines of badges to display using the `lineCount` prop. The component will intelligently wrap badges across lines while respecting the overflow constraints.

### Custom Rendering

Use `renderBadge` and `renderOverflow` props to fully customize how badges and overflow indicators are rendered, allowing complete control over styling and behavior.

### Performance Optimization

Badge widths are cached after first measurement, and the component uses ResizeObserver to efficiently respond to container size changes.

## Notes

- The component uses DOM measurement to calculate badge widths accurately
- Badge width cache persists across component instances for better performance
- Use `clearBadgeWidthCache()` export to clear the cache if needed
- Container must have a defined width for overflow calculations to work
