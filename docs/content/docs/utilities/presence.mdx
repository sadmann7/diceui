## Installation

### CLI

```package-install
npx shadcn@latest add "https://diceui.com/r/presence"
```

### Manual

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Copy and paste the following code into your project.

    <ComponentSource src="./registry/default/components/presence.tsx" />
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Usage

```tsx
import { Presence } from "@/components/presence"

export default function App() {
  const [open, setOpen] = React.useState(false)

  return (
    <Presence present={open}>
      <div
        data-state={open ? "open" : "closed"}
        className="data-[state=closed]:fade-out-0 data-[state=open]:fade-in-0 data-[state=closed]:animate-out data-[state=open]:animate-in"
      >
        This content will animate in and out
      </div>
    </Presence>
  )
}
```

### Render Function Pattern

Access presence state through a render function:

```tsx
import { Presence } from "@/components/presence"

export default function App() {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = React.useState(false)

  return (
    <Presence present={isOpen}>
      {({ present }) => (
        <div className={present ? "animate-in fade-in-0" : "animate-out fade-out-0"}>
          This content will animate based on presence state
        </div>
      )}
    </Presence>
  )
}
```

### Force Mounting

Use `forceMount` to keep elements mounted regardless of presence state. Useful for accessibility requirements and focus management:

```tsx
import { Presence } from "@/components/presence"

export default function App() {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = React.useState(false)

  return (
    <Presence present={isOpen} forceMount>
      <div 
        className={cn(
          "transition-opacity duration-200",
          isOpen ? "opacity-100" : "opacity-0"
        )}
      >
        This content will always be mounted but will fade in/out
      </div>
    </Presence>
  )
}
```
